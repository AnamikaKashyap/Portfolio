          Hi! I'm <strong>Anamika Kashyap</strong>, a passionate and performance-driven frontend developer based in Noida, India.
          I specialize in building complete frontend applications â€” not just designing user interfaces, but also managing logic, state, and API communication.
        </p>
        <p className="about-details">
          My core stack includes <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. I use Redux Toolkit for scalable and maintainable state management, including async data fetching using <code>createAsyncThunk</code> and slices.
          I integrate REST APIs and build dynamic, real-world UIs that are both performant and responsive.
        </p>
        <p className="about-extra">
          Whether working in teams or independently, I focus on clean code, component-based architecture, and delivering smooth user experiences.
          I'm open to full-time roles or freelance opportunities where I can contribute to impactful web products and continue growing as a frontend engineer.
        </p>
